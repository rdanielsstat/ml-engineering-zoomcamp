# Machine Learning Engineering Zoomcamp Coursework

Work and projects by Rob Daniels

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp**, a free, global, 4-month course on **ML Engineering** taught by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and the **DataTalks.Club** team.

I am incredibly thankful for this course. It provided an excellent, structured learning path from core ML concepts to deploying real-world applications. The hands-on exercises, projects, and community support have greatly enriched my understanding of machine learning engineering.

## Repository Contents

This repository holds my personal work, including:

- **Homework notebooks** – Assignments from various modules covering topics such as:
  - Linear and logistic regression  
  - Decision trees and ensemble learning  
  - Evaluation metrics and model validation  
  - Deep learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch  

- **Midterm Project** – A practical project implementing machine learning algorithms and applying end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.  

*Future updates may include additional capstone projects as I progress through the course.*

## About the Course

**Machine Learning Zoomcamp** teaches the complete ML engineering pipeline:

- **ML Models** – Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, neural networks  
- **Python Libraries** – NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Deployment and Production** – Docker, FastAPI, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda  
- **Practical Focus** – Real-world datasets, project-based learning, and portfolio-building  

The course is self-paced but also offers live cohorts with peer review, scoring, and certificates. All course materials are openly available in the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp).
