# 🚀 Machine Learning Engineering Portfolio

**Machine Learning Zoomcamp**

## Overview

This repository documents my end-to-end machine learning engineering work completed through the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp**, an intensive, production-oriented ML program created by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and the **DataTalks.Club** community.

The focus of this work is not just modeling, but the *full ML lifecycle*:
- Problem framing
- Data preparation and feature engineering
- Model training and validation
- Evaluation and iteration
- Deployment as scalable services
- Containerization and cloud-based serving

This repository reflects hands-on implementation of real-world ML workflows rather than purely academic exercises.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

### Core Machine Learning Foundations
- Linear regression implemented from scratch and with Scikit-Learn
- Logistic regression for classification
- Feature engineering and regularization
- Model validation and dataset splitting
- Evaluation metrics for regression and classification
- Cross-validation and model comparison

### Tree-Based & Ensemble Methods
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting with XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis

### Deep Learning
- Neural network fundamentals
- TensorFlow and Keras workflows
- PyTorch fundamentals
- Convolutional neural networks
- Transfer learning
- Model optimization strategies

### Production & Deployment
- Model serialization with Pickle
- FastAPI web services
- Docker containerization
- AWS Lambda deployment
- Kubernetes orchestration
- TensorFlow Serving

The emphasis throughout is on reproducibility, modular design, and deployment-ready architecture.
