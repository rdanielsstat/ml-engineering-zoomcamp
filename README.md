# Machine Learning Engineering Zoomcamp Coursework

Rob Daniels

This repository contains hands-on machine learning engineering work completed as part of the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp**, a free, global, 4-month course on applied **ML Engineering** taught by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and the **DataTalks.Club** team.

The work here focuses on building practical, end-to-end ML pipelines, from data preparation and modeling to evaluation and deployment, using modern Python tooling and reproducible workflows.

## Repository Structure

This repository includes two main components:

`exercises/`

Applied module work and experiments covering core machine learning engineering topics, including:

- Linear and logistic regression
- Decision trees and ensemble methods
- Evaluation metrics and validation strategies
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Introductory deep learning exercises

These notebooks emphasize practical implementation and experimentation with real and simulated datasets.

`ml_project/`

A complete end-to-end machine learning project demonstrating:

- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and selection using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation
- Reproducible project structure

This project is designed to mirror a realistic ML engineering workflow rather than a purely academic exercise.

Future additions may include further end-to-end projects as the repository evolves.

## About the Zoomcamp

The **Machine Learning Zoomcamp** covers the full ML engineering lifecycle:

- Modeling: linear and logistic regression, tree-based models, ensembles, neural networks
- Tooling: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Deployment: Docker, FastAPI, cloud services, and container-based workflows
- Best practices: reproducibility, project structure, evaluation, and monitoring

All course materials are open source and available in the official repository:
